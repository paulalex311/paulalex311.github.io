            <h3><a href="https://www.partsgeek.com/">Parts Geek</a></h3>
            <p>Poor: Parts Geek is a website for car parts.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast - Very basic on colors, nothing really pops out, white background</li>
                <li>Repetition - The menu items and parts as you scroll down seem to be the only things consistent. Other parts are different sizes and fonts. </li>
                <li>Alignment - The entire site is centered and very cluttered. Horizontally, most things are aligned after the big mess in the front page, which doesnt look good at all</li>
                <li>Proximity - Everything is bunched up together and has no gaps or dead space. </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a></h3>
            <p>Good: YouTube is a video and music sharing website and application.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast - Offers a light and dark mode for user preference, which can also help during low light. Buttons and titles are easily seen.</li>
                <li>Repetition - Everything is where you would expect it to be and nothing stands out in a bad way. Most buttons are the same size, font and color.  </li>
                <li>Alignment -The alignment is generally clean and functional. Key elements like the sidebar, video suggestions, and main content area are well-aligned, providing a structured layout.</li>
                <li>Proximity - The sidebar with shortcuts to subscriptions, trending videos, and library sections is placed close together for quick access. </li>
            </ul>
